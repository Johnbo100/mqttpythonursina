# mqttpythonursina
A test to get mpu6050 wireless data to Python and rotate a cube


Do not forget to install all libraries to your arduino

If you are on windows you should open an inbound port 1883 in the firewall. This will allow the mosquitto server to listen to incomming signals

make sure you change the wifi ssid and password if you change to another network. 
Also change the ip address in arduino code to the ip address of your mosquitto server/pc 

At one point I could not get windows 10 to recognise my esp8266 board. It was simply a usb cable problem.
